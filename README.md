### Purpose

The Learning Plan Skill takes personalization input and a learning objective and generates a sequence of reading, watching, and doing to achieve the learning objective.

### Overview

This Claude Skill generates a personalized learning plan for an arbitrary topic:

- selectively extracts relevant and mostly free learning content from across the web
- chooses content based on your learning style (doing, reading, watching, etc.)
- sequences content rationally for dependencies and prerequisite knowledge
- excludes content covering what you already know
- excludes content that doesn't support your learning objective
